# TASKS

**Source of truth** for open work. Edit here; commit to git.
**Rules:** [META.md](META.md) · **Activity log:** [TASKS-LOG.md](TASKS-LOG.md)
**Status:** `open` | `doing` | `next` | `done` | `drop`
**`next`:** one queued follow-on — visible while `doing` is elsewhere; not a second `doing`.
**Labels:** `DT###` — permanent id; do not reuse after close.

**Due:** optional date `YYYY-MM-DD` (not a hard deadline unless noted).

**Sort (litmus):** `P0 → P1 → TRIAGE → P2 → P3`; within each band **`doing` → `next` → `open`** — no higher-attention status below a lower one (e.g. no `doing`/`next` under `open`).

### DT123 — Task time ledger (per-DT visibility)

**When:** After **DT122** ccc slides ship · **not** credit-card — proper task.

**Feature (3 lines):**

1. **Roll up hours per DT###** from git commit spans, `TASKS-LOG` status transitions, and optional agent-session timestamps — retroactive for closed tasks (e.g. DT100) where data exists.
2. **Activity bands:** human prompting/work · Gluon autonomous (commit/build) · task `doing`/`open` wall time · idle/unattributed — best-effort from artifacts, not a stopwatch.
3. **Output:** per-task summary (md or script report) + lightweight log convention for new tasks so billing and retros don’t depend on chat memory.

**Done when:** `./scripts/task-time-report.py DT100` (or equivalent) produces defensible hour bands; documented hook for future DT rows.

### DT122 — CCC 2A — Mermaid-aware B6 slide upgrade

**Strategy:** [dt122/ccc-strategy.md](dt122/ccc-strategy.md) · **Source:** [dt122/bugatti-qos-ccc.md](dt122/bugatti-qos-ccc.md) → `bugatti-qos-ccc.pptx`

**2A scope (restrained — Guru scans for blocks, not bullets):**

- [ ] Mermaid diagram blocks in `bugatti-qos-ccc.md` (pipeline annotate · CSB/buffer-carve inset · validation stack)
- [ ] B6 render path: `assets/diagrams/b6/` + script (Mermaid → PNG); wire into `build-dt100-decks.py` / validate
- [ ] Visual-first slide reorder in md (diagrams early; owners on picture)
- [ ] `./scripts/run-deck-build.sh` — post-build checks pass
- [ ] Human cold read — no “performed better” than peer CCC decks

**Out of scope (abeyance):** swimlanes · template churn · HWv2 depth · informal peer huddle (follow-on after 2A ships)

**Done when:** `bugatti-qos-ccc.pptx` regen’d with Mermaid-driven PNGs; ready for informal W DRI huddle.

---

### DT120 — Pensieve `origin.md` → Gluon (close origin story)

**Pending closure** for Gluon origin in [CONSTITUTION.md](CONSTITUTION.md) — pattern only, no mixing.

**You (via Pensieve):**

- [ ] Export sanitized **`origin.md`** — how Pensieve hatched Gluon; job-search → work transition
- [ ] **Redact:** past employer names, compensation, interviews detail, PII, anything not safe for Upscale repo
- [ ] Review with human eyes before any commit

**Gluon (after import):**

- [ ] Fold into constitution (or `origin.md` + pointer) — keep **separation** rule visible
- [ ] No Pensieve chat/canvas as authority — file in git only after review

**Done when:** `origin.md` in repo, constitution references it, origin story no longer “pending.”

---

### DT121 — CLI toolbox (loose inventory)

**Model:** One ongoing task; **append** tools you’ve used before — no per-tool DT rows. Status stays `open` until you decide it’s “good enough” or fold into README/brew doc.

**Not done when:** every tool is installed — only when the list feels captured for Lepton (and optional one-liner install notes).

| Tool | Role | Install (macOS) | Notes |
|------|------|-----------------|-------|
| **glow** | Color markdown in terminal | `brew install glow` | `glow TASKS.md` · `-p` pager · themes via `GLOW_STYLE` — **likely** the one you forgot |
| **mdcat** | Markdown → terminal (links, code) | `brew install mdcat` | `mdcat file.md` · alternative to glow |
| **bat** | Syntax-highlighted cat (incl. `.md`) | `brew install bat` | `bat README.md` · not markdown-specific |
| **mdless** | Markdown pager | `brew install mdless` | `mdless file.md` |

**Add rows as you remember** (git, ssh, jq, ripgrep, `gh`, `uv`, etc.) — loose bullets OK in Notes column.

- [ ] Confirm which MD viewer you used before (glow vs mdcat vs other)
- [ ] Install chosen viewer on Lepton if missing
- [ ] Append other “past CLI” tools when they surface (no new DT per tool)

---

### DT119 — git workflow hooks (enforce policy) — **plan only, not started**

**Status:** Task created after Gluon ran `git commit` without waiting for explicit human OK (rule break). User reminder: *been there, done that* — rules need **tools**, not trust. A **2-minute spike was implemented and reverted**; do **not** reuse spike code — rebuild carefully.

**Why:** README rule #6 (human-only commit/push) must be **enforced**, not documented only.

---

**Design goals (when executing):**

- Git-tracked hooks under repo (e.g. `hooks/`) + `core.hooksPath` via documented setup
- **Human one-shot unlock** before commit vs push (separate tokens)
- Agent may `git add` / diff; **cannot** commit/push without human running allow + explicit approval
- Optional belt: Cursor `beforeShellExecution` to block `git commit` / `git push` in agent shell
- Fail closed; no `--no-verify` in agent docs

**Spike notes (reverted — reference only):**

| Idea | Spike behavior | Rebuild consideration |
|------|----------------|----------------------|
| Commit gate | `.allow-commit` file, `pre-commit` check, `post-commit` delete | Gitignore tokens; naming; audit trail? |
| Push gate | `.allow-push`, `pre-push` consume | Separate from commit; confirm remote policy |
| Secrets | Block staged `.env`, `credentials.json`, `.pem` | Expand list; false positives |
| Scripts | `allow-commit.sh`, `allow-push.sh`, `setup-git-hooks.sh` | Review UX; document in README |
| commit-msg | Non-empty message | Optional `DT###` reference lint |

**Execution checklist (all open):**

- [ ] Design review with human (you) — no implementation until OK
- [ ] Implement tracked `hooks/` + `scripts/` + `hooks/README.md`
- [ ] `.gitignore` unlock token files
- [ ] Update README rule #6 with real paths
- [ ] Run `./scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh` on Lepton; test commit blocked / allowed
- [ ] Test agent cannot commit without allow (manual or Cursor hook)
- [ ] Optional: `DT###` in commit-msg; org GitHub rulesets later

**Not in scope (v1):** Org-wide rulesets; teaching agents `--no-verify`.

**Trigger:** After DT100 Thu EOD or when you explicitly schedule DT119 **doing**.

---

### DT101 checklist

- [ ] Canvas `.canvas.data.json` — still under `~/.cursor/projects/.../canvases/`?
- [ ] Copy any missing items into this table
- [ ] Chat-only decisions captured here?
- [ ] Onboarding brew list — repo or external?

---

### DT118 (closed — template notes)

First working Gluon instance validated from git (stateless boot, sort litmus, constitution load). **Full bar** (kill agent, erase chat, clone, new model → full recovery): [CONSTITUTION.md](CONSTITUTION.md) *North star* — goal, not required yet.

Pattern for others (optional copy, any agent name, any edits) — like a pre-made `/etc/zshrc` plus task-tracking agent:

| Idea | Analog |
|------|--------|
| Pre-wired agent + task shell | `/etc/profile` or `/etc/zshrc` — sensible defaults, not mandatory |
| Stateless agent + git memory | Agent runs when repo opens; law/state in committed files |
| Personal hatch | Clone/fork; rename agent or skip; amend by owner judgment |

**When publishing a template:** ship minimum (constitution, tasks, log, README); no confidential Upscale content without approval; template export is follow-on work (e.g. DT116), not blocked.
